# VPN In a BOX
This project will enable you to configure a Raspberry Pi (or similar) to run OpenVPN on your network. 

This solution will enable you to connect devices such as ATV, PS4, Xbox, Smart TV etc (which do not support VPN) to the RPI just by changing the DNS.

You can run multiple RPIs on your network.

Once configured, all you will need to do is plug the RPI into your home router, and change the DNS on the device that you want to stream from.

## Preparation

You will need :

1) A VanishedVPN subscrption (from www.vanishedvpn.com )
2) A RPI (or similar) flashed with the latest version of Raspian
3) You should have flashed the image to your SD card, and powered up the device
4) Log onto the device via ssh

'ssh root@rasberrypi'
